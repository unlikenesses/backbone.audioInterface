## Backbone.js audio interface

Interface for manipulating a very stripped-down set of audio API oscillators, implemented in [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/). See it running at [CodePen](http://codepen.io/unlikenesses/full/VeQPQV/). 

Inspired by the much more sophisticated [Web Audio Playground](http://webaudioplayground.appspot.com/).

For other Backbone audio experiments, see my [audio yo yo](https://github.com/unlikenesses/audio-yo-yo) and [drum machine](https://github.com/unlikenesses/backbone.beats).
